SpaceX was founded in 2002 with the express purpose of driving down the cost of commercial spaceflight. One of the principal means of achieving this began in officially in 2013 with the annoucement of the rapid reuse lanuch system. Unofficially, reuse began with the failed Falcon 1 in 2008. Regardless, this post will take a look at SpaceX's progess since it's inception.

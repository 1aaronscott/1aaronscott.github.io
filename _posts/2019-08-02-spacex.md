SpaceX was founded in 2002 with the express purpose of driving down the cost of commercial spaceflight. One of the principal means of achieving this began in officially in 2013 with the announcement of the rapid reuse launch system. Unofficially, reuse began with the failed Falcon 1 in 2008. Regardless, this post will take a look at SpaceX's progess since it's introduction of the Falcon 9 launch vehicle family in 2010.

My initial hypothesis was that SpaceX's customer base would be majority public entities such as NASA or the military. The primary reasons was a larger potential customer base and therefore a greater opportunity to win contracts from governmental customers. I was wrong. While the very earliest customers where indeed governmental (Falcon 1's final flight was delivery of a Malaysian satellite), very quickly private customers booked payloads with Spacex. In fact, the majority of customers have been private.

Private customers are also in lead in terms of payload mass.

  b. costs. Is spacex profitable?

SpaceX has suffered some spectacular failures. The most recent was a high stakes, high speed landing on the autonomous drone ship _Of Course I Still Love You_. One of my initial interests in studying SpaceX's launch history was to see if there was any pattern to the failuers. Fortunately I found none. The only connection I did find was in the orbit types. Using a $${\chi}^2$$-test I found a significant relationship ($$ p < .01 $$) between orbit types and whether the customer was a public or private entity. Public customers, of which the majority is NASA, tend to prefer higher altitude orbits or low Earth orbit missions to the space station.

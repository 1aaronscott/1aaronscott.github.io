Today is the first official day of Unit 3. (Yesterday was Labor Day
 which we technically had off but still had a lecture video to watch
 and an assignment to complete. Lambda's schedule waits for no one and
 nothing!) Two months on the runaway freight train and I'm still
 wondering where its taking me. It was also troubling to find out news
 over the weekend about Lambda's [legal troubles in
 California](https://www.businessinsider.com/lambda-school-california-state-law-coding-bootcamp-y-combinator-2019-8). I
 took a leap of faith and left my job for this. I had been looking at
 getting in the data science field for several years (to my shame) but
 the one-two punch of Lambda's ISA and the increasingly poor
 atmosphere at my previous employer. It seemed like the right
 time. Did I make a mistake? With the talk about a looming downturn in
 the economy, did I shoot myself in the foot? Time will tall.

Last week was our first build week. This meant that the normal
schedule was suspended to allow for dedicated work in the unit 2
predictive modeling project. One thing that was better was I found an
acceptable dataset earlier on. In Unit 1 I thought I had to be much
more enthusiastic about the data in part because I thought each
successive unit would build on the same work done previously. Knowing
that wasn't the case made unit 2 easier to some extent. My project was
on [predicting a car's fuel
economy](https://github.com/1aaronscott/unit-2-project-fuel-economy)
based on past data. It was OK. The dataset which initially looked
feature-rich turned out to be somewhat lacking. While I think I did
well on the technical side of things (coding the models, delivering a
webapp), I still fell short on the visualizations. I could decide to
go in a data science direction which doesn't lean too much on viz but
my nature is to focus on the shortcomings so for now at least I can't
let it go and must get better in that area.

Lambda School is focused on two things: cramming an almost complete college-level, topic specific curriculum into a short 
time and taking students from zero to employable. We work on that second goal right from the beginning. This week we've been tasked
to think about and articulate our goals with an emphasis on making them [SMART](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mURVmfv-I1Y1AAi_sTcUYxtMIseTvWJVS_3JN9-PGdY/edit?usp=sharing). Here are mine which I plan to update and revise
as time passes.
* Identify location preferences if any
* Areas of specialization
* Employer preferences or targeting
* Work on growing network
  - participate more in TL, BH, AH zoom chats?

**What I look for in an employer**
The number one quality of a employer is support. A supportive culture is one where employees can enjoy working with one another
and don't spend much time dreaming about or actually looking for employment elsewhere. Support means employee retention! Other
ways to show support might be tuition reimbursement, gym membership subsidation, and community involvement projects. All of these
lead to better individual employees. Better employees make the company better!
